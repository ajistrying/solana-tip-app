# Welcome to the Solana Tip App!

**_Note: Solana's mainnet is still in beta at the time of this writing, due to the nature of this new technology evolving, I'll try my best to keep this updated, but make sure you know where you are sending your solana at all time, double and triple check the address/addresses you are sending to!!!!_**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I leveraged the [solana/wallet-adapter](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter) and [solana/web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) packages in order to create this app as well, so shoutout to everyone who worked on those two libraries to make working with common solana api functionality in javascript possible/ a breeze!

## Motivation
I'm a hands-on learner, and when I first heard about Solana, I knew I had to build something around it in order to best understand it. This is the first project that came to mind once I understood the tools that were available to me.

I'm open sourcing this in the spirit of pretty much all great web3 projects being open sourced, although I wouldn't consider this a big web3 project, its a start! I'd love for people to fork it and creat their own bigger and better thing! I'll be working on this off and on to improve it and hopefully expand it to other coins as well.

Cheers!

## Usage
1. Clone the repo into your fav directory and run `yarn start`
2. When you've pulled the code down, make sure you have two solana wallets to test with, and make sure to change the network to 'devnet'! This is located in the App.js file at:
`const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet;`
For reference, the full list of options is: 'Devnet', 'Testnet', or 'Mainnet'.
3. Have fun tipping!

## Contributions
If you'd like to contribute, please do! I'm by no means an expert in React (I work full time in Ruby/Ruby on Rails), so I'll be re-factoring as time passes and I learn more, but feel free to open up a PR and help out if you'd like!
